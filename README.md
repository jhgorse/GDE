# GDE

**a Good data-flow Development Environment**

Inspired by National Instrument's LabVIEW, i.e. the Virtual Instrumentation Electronic Workbench; the [Burroughs B5000](http://www.ajwm.net/amayer/papers/B5000.html); Alan Turing et. al., GDE is designed to achieve 
* Single-pass compile from data-flow code to native baremetal machine code
* [MMU (malloc/dealloc) independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit#Unisys_MCP_Systems_.28Burroughs_B5000.29)
* Interactive shell environment for live development
  * Immediate and unequivocal feedback to build user's intuition
  * [Graphical front-end](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/7537/en) which provides powerful visual metaphors consistent with prior knowledge and expectations
